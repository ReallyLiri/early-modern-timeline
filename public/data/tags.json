"According to \"Mathematics in the 17th and 18th centuries\" (Britannica), The increased interest in curves can be partially attributed to:\n(a) The recovery and Latin translation of the classical treatises of Apollonius, Archimedes, and Pappus.\n(b) The increasing importance of curves in applied fields such as astronomy, mechanics, optics, and stereometry.",
"During the 17th century, more curves that could not be generated by a point moving through space were discussed. Examples include the cycloid, Galileo's parabolic trajectory and de Roberval's research (trochoid)."
