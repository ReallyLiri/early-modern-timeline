        "Stevin showed how the usual arithmetic of whole numbers could be extended to decimal fractions using rules that determined the positioning of the negative powers of 10 (1.2 \u21d2 2 is 10^-1\u2026).",
        "Stevin's proposal required a rejection of the distinction in Euclidean geometry between magnitude, which is continuous, and number, which is a multitude of indivisible units. Decimal fractions seemed to imply that the unit could be subdivided and that arbitrary continuous magnitude could be represented numerically."
